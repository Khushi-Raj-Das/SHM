Developed a deep learning-based system for Structural Health Monitoring and Disaster Assessment using U-Net and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with the xBD dataset. The system analyzes satellite images to quickly and accurately assess building damage before disasters, offering an efficient, automated alternative to traditional methods. Tested in real-world scenarios, it demonstrated improved speed, reliability, and safety in damage evaluation.
